            "description": "<p>Legend holds that the amurruns-known as catfolk to others-were created as guardians against threats to home, nature, and the world at large. While the goddess Adanye is not considered to be their creator, she is said to have mentored these first guardians, teaching them the skills necessary to protect and defend, both in combat and in careful interaction with others. She also taught the importance of what they protected, identifying the hearth and the home, as well as the right to self-determination and to solitude, as worthy of defense. She is said to have instilled in the amurruns their need for solitude and their esteem of imagination. A master teacher, she is depicted as a graying catfolk woman or a cat by the hearth fire, her large, gentle eyes full of wisdom.</p>\n<p>The tenets of Adanye's faith are few and flexible. She helps the curious and the wandering to retain their sense of self and their need to stay safe as they discover and grow. She honors the hours spent daydreaming on the hearth, whether that hearth is next to the fire pit at a remote campsite or in the kitchen of a generations-old homestead. She does not proscribe much. She adds to the serendipitous outlook of the catfolk, enhancing their inborn curiosity. Her worship tends to temper willfulness and wanderlust, reminding her followers of the safety and security to be found in having a spot of their own, even if that spot is temporary. She understands that sometimes the best protection is a retreat and gently reminds her followers of the virtue of impermanence and of existing in the moment. Rather than looking into the past or the future, she enjoins fully inhabiting the present-the place where one is, the hearth by which one naps, the company that one currently keeps, especially when it can be done in solitude.</p>\n<p>Because the catfolk of Southern Garund have not established large communities outside of Murraseth, there are no temples to Adanye outside of their homeland, only small shrines erected by travelers, perhaps near seldom-used mountain trails or in the corners of large temples dedicated to other gods. Her worshippers often paint or sketch her holy symbol, a simple paw print in orange (or on an orange background), which is sometimes enhanced with sketched flames or another symbol of fire, in an inconspicuous cornerstone of a building or on a fallen log. Adanye has an affinity with Desna and with Shelyn, given their overlapping interests in dreamers and individualism. Although she has a longstanding rivalry with the Osirian feline goddess Bastet, she does not spend much time feuding. Adanye's care is wholly enjoined upon her followers.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> keep your counsel, follow your heart, appreciate a warm hearth, defend those who welcome you into their home</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> force anyone into drudgery or mindless work, deny support to loved ones, surrender when escape is an option, destroy a place that has given you shelter</p>"

He is skilled enough with weapons, but prefers to use his own abilities-his powerful fists, lethal fangs, sharp horns, and deadly tail. His terrible grasp extends beyond life into death, as well. Occasionally, those slain in combat by Angazhan's minions are reincarnated forcefully into an ape-like creature in the service of the Ravenous King. This curse causes the victim to serve eternally, and only upon death is there a chance for their soul to be retrieved before it slips into the Boneyard, to be sent on and suffer a never-ending torment in the Abyss.</p>\n<p>A pledge to Angazhan is a commitment to acquiring power. Angazhan encourages followers to destroy all who oppose them with relentless force, to dominate until nothing is left to challenge, and to treat obstacles as something to be crushed with swiftness. Those who fail these commands are quick to be cast aside. This strength lures dangerous figures, thievish creatures, and terrifying beings. Followers share less of a bond and more of an understanding that in the end they serve a lord whose dominance can't be rivaled.</p>\n<p>Angazhan is the patron of Usaro, a feared and hated charau-ka city in the Mwangi Expanse.

They seek to emulate their god by growing large, either by developing their muscles or becoming immensely fat.</p>\n<p>Balumbdar himself is uncaring about how great size and strength is used, but his followers generally divide themselves into two schools of thought.

Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus's texts-both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter-has been the order's primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 AR.

Mazludeh's efforts elevated her to true divinity and the status of the matron goddess of the nation of Holomog. Now the goddess of negotiations and treaties, her followers often travel with merchants and ambassadors. She is also considered the diplomat to the other empyreal lords, able to pass on prayers to those most suited to answer them and persuade celestial beings to see to their fulfillment.

Mazludeh sees the love and care in all Mwangi communities and offers them all the protections she can. Even before her presence there, many edicts of her faith were already common practice, expected of any contributing member of society. New worshippers of Mazludeh were thus required to make very little change to the way they already lived their lives.</p>\n<p>Mazludeh is often depicted either as a giant serpent with a mane of eggs and fresh figs, or as a woman with serpents for hair. It is heavily debated among scholars what this dual nature could mean, but most agree that her divinity likely predates humans, and that they adopted her later on. Unlike her worship in other parts of the world, worshippers in Mwangi tend to embrace Mazludeh's duality. To deny either side of her would be to deny a part of her, and both are necessary to fully understand the deity. To them, she represents not only unity with one's neighbors, but unity and coexistence with nature. Living in balance with the food one grows, the animals one hunts, and the land one lives on is just as important anything that happens within the walls of a home.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> seek to improve yourself and your community, trust those you work with, encourage cooperation</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> betray another's trust, place conflict between ideological differences over people's lives</p>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p>When casting the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.ckUOoqOM7Kg7VqxB]{Avatar}</em> spell, a worshipper of Mazludeh gains the following additional abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Mazludeh</strong> Speed 70 feet, climb speed 50 feet, shield (hardness 15, can't be damaged)</p>\n<p>Melee <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> viper strike (reach 15 feet), Damage [[/r {6d10+6}[piercing]]]{6d10+6 piercing damage}</p>\n<p>Ranged <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> stone rain (range 120 feet), Damage [[/r {6d6+3}[bludgeoning]]]{6d6+3 bludgeoning damage}</p>"

For the Crimson Reclaimers, this means never forgetting the pain and trauma caused by the Whispering Tyrant in Lastwall, and channeling that grief into fuel for righteous revenge. Beyond these two major divine influences, three other deities represent values the followers of the pantheon hold dear. Gorum (Our Lord in Iron) preaches strength and victory in battle. Iomedae (The Inheritor) led the charge on many successful attacks against Tar-Baphon, so it's only natural that her legendary deeds, and sense of honor, justice, and valor speak to followers of Sorrow's Sword. Many consider Arazni (The Unyielding) to be a strong part of this pantheon, due to her edict to survive at all costs and her abhorrence for the creation of unwilling undead. Arazni's inclusion is complicated by Vildeis and Ragathiel's feelings about evil, which is why Arazni is not an official member of the pantheon among all followers.</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> vengeance, reclaiming lost homelands, drawing strength from sorrow</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> avenge the wronged, destroy evildoers, lead the charge in battle, remember your community's history</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> cower from combat, forgive those who have committed grave offenses, abandon or deceive allies</p>"

He spreads cancer by touch, inciting cells to rebellion, and his breath causes outbreaks of hives and asthma attacks in those nearby.

He collaborates with Apollyon to spread diseases from livestock, rendering butchers' larders barren.

In the past, Walkena was a mortal descendant of the gods that ruled over Mzali in ancient times, one of the sun kings from an old empire and a golden age of the city. Ages later, his preserved body was found by members of the Council of Mwanyisa, who ruled Mzali at that time. Believing him to be an omen of the city's impending resurgence, the council took him to put him on display in Mzali.
